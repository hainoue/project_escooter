# Introduction
This is a documentation for the data analysis project I completed as a part of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. 

## Statement of Purpose
This project aimed to analyze public/open data about electric scooter usage to find key characteristics, and correlation with public transportation and weather.

## Background
As we saw more and more electric scooters (e-scooters) or rental bikes (or electric bikes) in our daily basis, it is becoming a common way of transportation--often, referred to micromobility. [Study](https://www.wired.com/story/e-scooter-micromobility-infographics-cost-emissions/) shows these micromobility is a solution to the environmental problems since they are more sustainable and efficient compared to conventional vehicles. For example, fueling cost of e-scooter is simply 1.6% of conventional vehicles. 
However, as the name of micromobility suggests, e-scooters are not designed for long distance trips. It often used to transport between other means of public transportation. This study tried to catch how e-scooters were used in the city setting where other transportation system such as bus and metro exists.
